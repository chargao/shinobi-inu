Shinobi Inu is an adventure puzzle game where the main character, a ninja whose entire clan was turned into shibas by an evil witch, must use a blend of puzzle-solving tactics and fighting to defeat the witch and her henchmen. There's a twist though: even though the ninja can turn back and forth at will, he is deaf as a human, and blind as a dog. Will he be able to escape his befallen dojo? Can he make his way to the evil witch's lair? Will he be able to defeat the witch and save his clan? Play as the Shinobi Inu, and find out!
